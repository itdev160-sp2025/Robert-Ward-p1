#Funko Pop Market & Culture Website

## Project Description
This project is a fun website that shows off some cool Funko Pop details and explains the culture behind collecting them. You'll see a table listing Funko Pops with info like their release date, price, rarity, and dimensions. There will also be a section that dives into the background of Funko Pop collecting-covering everything from how pricing works to the company's origins.

## What We'll Do
**Funko List:**
Create a table with details for each Funko Pop (release date, release price, current/highest price, rarity, dimensions).

**Culture Section:**
Write a short explanation about Funko Pop collecting culture. Think about why people collect them, how rarity influences pricing, and a little bit about the company's history. 

**Navigation:**
Add a simple navigation menu at the top that links the Funko list, the culture section, and back to the top of the page so visitors can easily jump around.

**Style & Script:**
Use an external CSS file for styling (also using google font ) and add a little JavaScript to insert dynamic message.

## Steps to Build the Website
**HTML Setup:**
Build out the structure using an HTML file with sections for the Funko list, culture info, and navigation links.

**CSS Styling:**
Using an external CSS file I;ll import a Google Font and set up styles for text, navigation, table, and overall layout.

**JavaScript**
I'll create a js file that uses DOM to add a dynamic market update or fun message.
